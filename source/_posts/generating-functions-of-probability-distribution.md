Probability mass/density distribution have defined generating functions which faciliate the derivation and the understanding of different probability distributions.

# Probability generating functions for discrete variables

The probability generating function is defined as

$$ \Phi_X(t) = E[t^X] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P(X=k) t^k  $$

which is a power series representation of the probability mass function of the random variables. The probability of random variable $X=k$ is generated by

$$ P(X=k) = \frac{\Phi_X^{(k)}(0)}{k!} $$

If random variables have equal probability generating functions, then they have identical distributions.

## moments gotten from derivatives

Two important results (mean and variance) can be obtained by differentiating $\Phi_X(t)$ with respect to $t$. The first derivative is

$$ \frac{d\Phi_X(t)}{dt} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} kP(X=k)t^{k-1} $$

and the second derivative is

$$ \frac{d^2\Phi_X(t)}{dt^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k(k-1)P(X=k)t^{k-2} $$

We assign $t=1$ and get

$$ \Phi'_X(1) = E(X) $$

$$ \Phi''_X(1) = E(X^2)-E(X) $$

So from derivates of $\Phi_X(t)$ we get

$$ V(X) = E(X^2)-[E(X)]^2 = \Phi''_X(1) + \Phi'_X(1) - [\Phi'_X(1)]^2 $$

## sum of multivariate discrete distributions

For a multivariate discrete distribution, the original $\Phi_X(t)$ is defined as

$$ \begin{aligned}
\Phi_{X+Y}(t) &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P(X+Y=k)t^k \\
              &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} t^k \sum_{r=0}^{r=k} P(X=r)P(Y=k-r) \\
              &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sum_{r=0}^{r=k} P(X=r)t^rP(Y=k-r)t^{k-r} \\
              &= \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=r}^{\infty} P(X=r)t^rP(Y=k-r)t^{k-r}
\end{aligned} $$

The change of summation order is analogous to the change of integration order

$$ \int_0^{\infty}dy \int_0^y dx = \int_0^{\infty} dx \int_x^{\infty} dy $$

Thus, the probability generating function of variable $X+Y$ is equal to the product of respective probability generating functions of $X$ and $Y$

$$ \Phi_{X+Y}(t) = \Phi_X(t) \Phi_Y(t) $$

which also stands for *moments generating functions*.

# Moments generating functions

Moments generating functions are defined as

$$ M_X(t) = E[e^{Xt}] = \begin{cases} \sum_i e^{tx_i} P(X=x_i) & \text{for a discrete distribution} \\ \int e^{tx} f(x) dx & \text{for a continuous distribution} \end{cases} $$

The exponent can be expand as a power series as

$$ M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = E[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^k}{k!} t^k] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^k}{k!} E[X^k] $$

So moments of different orders can generated from corresponding derivates of $M_X(t)$

$$ E[X^k] = M_X^{(k)}(0) $$

## sum of multivariate distributions

Similarly, for an independent multivariate $X+Y=N$ distribution, the moments generating function is defined as

$$ \begin{aligned}
M_{X+Y}(t) &= E[e^{(X+Y)t}] \\
           &= \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{nt} f_{X+Y}(n) dn \\
           &= \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{nt} dn \int_{0}^{n} f_X(x)f_Y(n-x) dx \\
           &= \int_{0}^{\infty} dn \int_{0}^{n} e^{(n-x)t} e^{xt} f_X(x)f_Y(n-x) dx \\
           &= \int_{0}^{\infty} dx \int_{x}^{\infty} e^{(n-x)t} e^{xt} f_X(x)f_Y(n-x) dn \\
           &= \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{xt} f_X(x) dx \int_{x}^{\infty} e^{(n-x)t} f_Y(n-x) dn \\
           &= M_{X}(t)M_{Y}(t)
\end{aligned} $$

which is the product of respective moments generating functions of independent variables $X$ and $Y$. This property is useful in the derivation of Poisson/Binomial distributions from Binomial/Bernoulli distributions or Gamma distribution from exponential distribution.

# Characteristic functions

 Characteristic functions are defined as

$$ C_X(t) = E[e^{iXt}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{ixt} f(x) dx $$

It's analogous to moments generating functions $C_X(t) = M_X(it)$. So they share similar properties including,

$$ E[X^k] = (-i)^k C_X^k(0) $$

$$ C_{X+Y}(t) = C_X(t)C_Y(t) $$

Besides, $C_X(t)$ is exactly the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ and *vice versa*.

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C_X(t) e^{-ixt} dt $$
