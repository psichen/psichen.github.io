function(annexin V stabilizes membranes on the seond timescale)
lattice(A5 p6 hexagonal lattice & non-p6 trimer at the p6 complex axis localtion)
non-p6(A5 non-p6 trimer rotates constantly with two favered positions: up & down)
affinity(A5 p6 hexagonal and non-p6 trimer have different affinities to Ca2+)
glue(Ca2+ acts as molecular glue between two negatively charged surface)
