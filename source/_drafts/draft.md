## SNR ##
Bell is the unit to describe the ratio of power,
$$
B = \log(\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}})
$$
So decibel is defined as,
$$
dB = 10 \log(\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}})
$$
just like decimeter. For non-power quantities like voltage or pressure, the power is proportional to the square of voltage or pressure, so the decibel is defined as,
$$
dB = 20 \log(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}})
$$
