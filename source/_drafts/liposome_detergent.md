1. Flip-flop is often the rate-limiting factor of solubilization. In turn, trans-membrane flipping depends upon the size and polarity of the detergent headgroup
2. insertion of cholesterol molecules into the lipid bilayer protects it from solubilization
3. Only surfactants with moderate hydrophobicity form perforated vesicles before the formation of mixed micelles
